# python_scratch
This is my scratch space for various python things I'm playing with. It's also my attempt to finally learn how Git works and how to integrate it with my local files and software programs.

Here is the process for merging updates from my local repository (Windows 10) into the remote one on Github:

1) Open Github Desktop
2) Copy updated files into the local python_scratch folder (or modify them in place)
  a) NOTE: If you modify the files directly within the repo directory, the Github Desktop app automagically shows changes.
3) Type in a Commit message in the "Summary" box to describe the changes. If you want to change the branch I think you just select a different branch in the middle tab.
4) Press "Commit".
5) The "Origin" tab on the right should update to show that there are changes to send. Press it to upload the changes to Github.
6) Go to your Github account in the web browser and merge the changes into master when you are done modifying the branch.
